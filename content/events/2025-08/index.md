Based on [the poll results](https://discourse.educationalgameclub.com/t/poll-game-for-august-2025), we'll be discussing [Stick and Split](https://www.maypoleeducation.com/families/our-games) by [Maypole Education](https://www.maypoleeducation.com/), a math game that helps children understand what multiplication and division really mean rather than merely memorizing their times tables.

The game may seem simple at first, but it holds **surprising depth** for those who look closely. <a href="https://podcast.mathisfigureoutable.com/1062400/episodes/15216096-ep-209-stick-and-split" target="_blank">This podcast episode</a> does a great job highlighting some of these deeper insights.
