### About Socrates Jones
[Socrates Jones](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/) was primarily developed by Connor Fallon and Valeria Reznitskaya with advice from Andy Norman, a philosophy professor at Carnegie Mellon University. It takes inspiration from Andy's [reason-giving game](https://www.academia.edu/4269933/How_to_Play_the_Reason_Giving_Game), a model he developed for rational discourse. It borrows mechanics from the courtroom trial game [Ace Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney) and applies them to philosophical debate.

The game's primary developers published **reflections about the game's design**:
- [Making a Debate Game: The Design Challenges of Socrates Jones](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-debate-game-the-design-challenges-of-socrates-jones) by Connor Fallon (2013)
- [Socrates Jones: Education and Hobbyist Game Design](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/socrates-jones-education-and-hobbyist-game-design) by Valeria Reznitskaya (2013)

[The Wikipedia page for *Socrates Jones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates_Jones:_Pro_Philosopher) is another good source about the game's origins and design.

The sequel to *Socrates Jones*, [Pro Philosopher 2: Governments & Grievances (2024)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120070/Pro_Philosopher_2_Governments__Grievances/), uses the same format to explore various foundational political ideas. Through playtesting, they discovered that [the most difficult chapter tended to be the debate against the political ideas that the player agreed with the most](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/lessons-from-the-political-minefield-of-pro-philosopher-2)!
