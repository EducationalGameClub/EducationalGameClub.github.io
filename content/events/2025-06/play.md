# Playing Geniventure

<a target="_blank" href="https://learn.concord.org/geniventure">Geniventure</a> is designed to be played in a classroom with an instructor so playing it on your own involves a few extra steps. This short guide explains how to get started.

## Options for Playing Geniventure

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://geniventure.concord.org/">Play without an account</a>. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">The game won't save your progress.</span> If you close the window, your progress will be lost.
2. **Play with a student account <span style="color: green">(recommended)</span>.** This is the easiest way to save your progress, but note that since your student account will be connected to my class, your game progress will be visible to me. **To create a student account connected to my class:**
