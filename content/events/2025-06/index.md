Based on [the poll results](https://discourse.educationalgameclub.com/t/poll-game-for-june-2025), we'll be discussing [Geniventure](./play.html) by [The Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/), a game where players breed dragons to learn about heredity, genetics, and the protein-to-trait relationship. Designed for middle and high school students.

The game is designed for classrooms so I've created a couple of guides to make things easier since we'll be playing independently:
- **[How to Play Geniventure](./play.html).** Steps to set up the game.
- **[Geniventure Hints](./hints.html).** Offers background normally provided by a teacher.

Thoughts on the game before the event? Share them on ðŸ’¬ [the forum](https://discourse.educationalgameclub.com/t/discussion-of-geniventure).
