We'll be discussing [Beats Empire (2019)](https://info.beatsempire.org/), a game about running a music studio: analyze trends and help artists reach the top of the charts. The game is designed to assess data analysis skills (rather than teach them) in middle schools, aligned with widely used US K-12 standards. It is a [Serious Play 2019 Silver Medal Winner](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115134932/https://seriousplayconf.com/2019-award-winners/).
