The next meeting of the Educational Game Club will be on Thursday January 16. It'll be [an onlineÂ meeting using Google Meet]($$CallUrl$$).

Weâ€™ll be discussing the game [Headlines and High Water](https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/play/headlines/) by [Field Day](https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/), a game where you play a journalist investigating a catastrophic flood. The game teaches media literacy ideas such as how to know what sources of information are reliable. At [Games for Change](https://www.gamesforchange.org/) 2024, [the game received awards in two categories](https://www.gameshub.com/news/news/games-for-change-2024-award-winners-2642609/): Best in Learning & Best in Civics. Itâ€™s a free short educational game, taking about 2 hours to complete, designed for grades 6 to 9.

Before the event, you are encouraged to play [Headlines and High Water](https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/play/headlines/) and think about what we can learn from it for designing other educational games. But playing the game is optional and the event is open to everyone. Feel free to invite anyone who you think might be interested in the discussion.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for games we should consider in the future, feel free to email meÂ atÂ [EducationalGameClub@gmail.com](mailto:EducationalGameClub@gmail.com).
