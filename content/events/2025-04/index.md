### About iCivics
[iCivics](https://icivics.org/) is a non-profit founded in 2009 by former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Its mission: "ensure every student receives a high-quality civic education, and becomes engaged in&mdash;and beyond&mdash;the classroom."

They've created [nearly 20 civics games](https://ed.icivics.org/teach?search_api_fulltext=&f%5B0%5D=content_type%3Aflash_game), many in partnership with [Filament Games](https://www.filamentgames.com/).

[This page about the history of iCivics](https://vision.icivics.org/about/history/) is quite informative. It includes this story about how the current CEO, Louise Dubé, discovered iCivics through her middle school son:
> “Homework first,” she reminded her son upon discovering him playing a game one evening. *But this was the homework.* The game spurred a flurry of questions and conversations between Dubé and her son that night on how government is meant to work. He concluded by blurting out, “All of school should be like iCivics.” She, too, was persuaded.
