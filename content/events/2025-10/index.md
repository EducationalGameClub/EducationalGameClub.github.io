We'll be discussing [Zoombinis (2015)](https://www.zoombinis.com) by [TERC](https://www.terc.edu/), a puzzle game that emphasizes logical reasoning. Solving puzzles requires the player to develop theories, test them, collect evidence based on their successes and failures, and then refine those theories. TERC published [this page about the game's educational value](https://www.zoombinis.com/education).

[Zoombinis (2015)](https://www.zoombinis.com) is a remake of the 1996 game [Logical Journey of the Zoombinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Journey_of_the_Zoombinis) by [Broderbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderbund).
