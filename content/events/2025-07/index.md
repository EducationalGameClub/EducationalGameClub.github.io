We'll be playtesting and discussing [Rogue Story](./play.html), an early-stage prototype by FranÃ§ois Boucher-Genesse. He'll be in attendance and interested in our feedback and ideas about improving the game. This will give the discussion a special grounding in reality and we may even get to see how some of our ideas play out in practice. A particular focus will be critiquing how the game teaches the player new mechanics.

Genre-wise, it's a story telling roguelike deckbuilder (think *Balatro*). [Watch the trailer](./trailer.html) to get a feel for it.

### Housekeeping
- Playing the game before the event is encouraged but not required. The event is dedicated to discussion, with someone playing live so we can reference gameplay as needed.
- The event is open to everyone so feel free to invite others.
- [Suggest an educational game or prototype](https://forms.gle/Sv7Y6ixNXw9oyFSc6) for a future event.

### About Rogue Story
[Rogue Story](./play.html) is a side project by FranÃ§ois to explore how recent developments in various AI technologies could both 1) enable new kinds of gameplay and 2) transform game development processes, tools, and workflows. The project began as an educational game but has since evolved and is no longer focused on language skills typically taught in school.

Although [Rogue Story](./play.html) isn't an educational game, it has a lot to teach us about how games function as learning environments. A key part of the discussion will be critiquing and improving how the game teaches new mechanics. The best games do this with a minimum of words and instructions&mdash;instead, they teach experientially by designing things for the player to do. We've previously discussed games that do this well, such as [Portal](/events/2024-12/) and [Slice Fractions](/events/2025-05/).

Professionally, FranÃ§ois develops educational games, including [Slice Fractions](/events/2025-05/), which we've previously discussed.
