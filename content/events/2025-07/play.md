# Play *Rogue Story*

**Rogue Story currently only runs on *Microsoft Windows*.**

## Steps to Play
1. [Download *Rogue Story* prototype (4.5 GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gQ-iwsenIx7GjT6nH5jFv1frpC5WrkHy/view?usp=sharing)
2. Unzip `RogueStory V00.14.01.zip`
3. Open `RogueStory V00.14.01/Rogue Story.exe`
4. **Play the game and reflect on your experience.** A particular focus of our discussion will be critiquing how the game teaches the player new mechanics. The best games do this with a minimum of words and instructions&mdash;instead, they teach experientially by designing things for the player to do. We've previously discussed games that do this well, such as [Portal](/events/2024-12/) and [Slice Fractions](/events/2025-05/).
    - **If the game is taking a while to start,** don't worry&mdash;the first launch can sometimes take a few minutes. Windows may be running a quick security scan in the background (via *Microsoft Defender*). Once that's done, the game will launch.
