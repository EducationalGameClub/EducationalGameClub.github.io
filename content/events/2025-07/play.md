# Play Rogue Story

**Rogue Story currently only runs on Microsoft Windows.**

## Steps to Play
1. [Download Rogue Story prototype (4.9 GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gQ-iwsenIx7GjT6nH5jFv1frpC5WrkHy/view?usp=sharing)
2. Unzip `RogueStory V00.14.01.zip`
3. Open `RogueStory V00.14.01/Rogue Story.exe`
4. **Play the game and reflect on your experience.** A particular focus of our discussion will be critiquing how the game teaches the player new mechanics. The best games do this with a minimum of words and instructions&mdash;instead, they teach experientially by designing things for the player to do. We've previously discussed games that do this well, such as [Portal](/events/2024-12/) and [Slice Fractions](/events/2025-05/).
