# Educational Game Club
Each month, we pick an educational game, play it, and then meet to discuss it. Itâ€™s like a book club but for educational games instead of books.

[Subscribe to Educational Game Club](https://forms.gle/zqG56ErXTdNzSTF6A) to get notified each time we schedule an event.

<!-- **The next event** will take place in February and will be announced soon. -->
